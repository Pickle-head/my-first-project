# About my first game
built a rock paper scissors game it simple but cool!
hoping to improve the concept soon 
_It's all about the progress!_


# How to use 
 its easy just _run the code_ and **type in "rock", "paper" or "scissors"** as a option for the player then the computer will pick its option to play with, at the end you will find out we won the game by looking at the out **"You win!" or "You lose"**

 # More option coming soon!
